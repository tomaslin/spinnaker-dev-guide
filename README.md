# Introduction

Spinnaker \([http://www.spinnaker.io](http://www.spinnaker.io)\) is an open source, multi-cloud continuous delivery platform built by Netflix in partnership with Google, Microsoft, and others. At Netflix, Spinnaker powers over 4,000 deployments a day. With Spinnaker, you can easily automate complex delivery processes into repeatable pipelines that enable rapid deployments with confidence.

This Guide was created to document best practices in extending Spinnaker to support your own integrations with Spinnaker.

We start with a tutorial for developers interested in talking to the Spinnaker API in their own projects, without making changes to Spinnaker itself.

For those who do want to make code changes and contributions to Spinnaker, this guide will provide instructions on how to set up your development environment, understand the Spinnaker project layout and how to add your own stages, notifications, CI integrations and cloud providers.
